In addition to that, multiple graphs depicting the ranking of all current chess players, per age and country. The graphs we will attempt making are an interactive map, and a simple interactive histogram regrouping the data of ranking per age of the player. A possible idea would be to make (if possible) another final fun interaction similar to the akinator game but with only chess players</p>"
